Up until now I thought, "What's the point of making friends if my Heirophant is the only one who understands me? He is the one who has always been by my side. He's the only one who has ever been there for me. They don't understand. No one does." Things like that. But Jotaro had saved me, didn't he? And suddenly, I was surrounded by people who understood me, who were just like me! I guess that's why I never thought twice about leaving with them, if it meant that I could have a chance at friendship.
I don't have any regrets. None whatsoever.
My family cat growing up ran away a while ago. I wonder how little Momo is doing these days?
If I had a sibling, I wonder how differently my life would turn out?
